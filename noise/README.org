* Protocol
The protocol was heavily inspired by the [[https://github.com/joostjager/whatsat#protocol][WhatSat protocol]]:

| record type | length (bytes) | value                                                           |
|-------------+----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|    34349341 |             32 | key send preimage                                               |
|    34349334 |       variable | chat message                                                    |
|    34349335 |             65 | compressed signature + recovery id                              |
|    34349339 |             33 | sender pubkey                                                   |
|    34349343 |              8 | timestamp in nano seconds since unix epoch (big endian encoded) |

The key differences are that we don't explicitly pass the sender pubkey, since
we can recover that from the signature itself, and we use the compressed 64
byte signature, instead of the DER encoded signature. This saves us 33 bytes
for the pubkey and ~7 bytes for the signature, but requires that we change the
TLV type for the signature (from ~34349337~ to ~34349335~).

The signature is computed by serializing all other TLV fields, hex-encoding
the resulting TLV payload, and signing it using ~lightning-cli signmessage~
returning the ~zbase32~ encoded signature. The signature consists of a 1 byte
recovery ID and the 64 byte raw signature.
